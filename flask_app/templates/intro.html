                Renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy, plays an increasing role in the energy supply of the world. 
                This trend will continue because global energy demand is increasing, and the use of nuclear power and traditional 
                sources of energy like coal and oil is unsafe and leads to large CO₂ emissions.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, energy production from wind energy has grown rapidly in Europe, and the capacity of wind energy 
                production has doubled from 2009 to 2010.
            </p>

            <p>
                The levels of production of wind energy are hard to predict due to the potentially unstable weather conditions 
                present at the wind farm. In particular, wind speed is crucial for energy production based on wind, and it may vary daily.
            </p>

            <p>
                Energy suppliers are interested in accurate predictions to avoid overproduction by coordinating the collaborative 
                production of traditional plants and weather-dependent energy sources. The energy can be predicted using the power curve 
                and the wind speed.
